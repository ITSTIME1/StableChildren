# StableChildren (AI program for children)
## Introduce üëã
Hello, Welcome to my **'StableChildren'** repository which for childs. Nowdays 'thinking' is very important better than whatever we thought. so i've been thinking about what programs can help children improve their thinking way.

**I wanted children to think broadly through paintings.** when we are thinking about difficult problem or easy or whatever it is we imagine that. we can imagine related to that To help understand when we are reading books "Kongjwi and Patjwi (ÏΩ©Ï•êÌå•Ï•ê)" **which a traditional Korean romance story from the Joseon Dynasty with a kindergarten teacher** children can think that 'what is that?', 'i wonder that word.' and then teacher is answerd(teaching) that it is. **So far, what I've been saying is 'curiousity that children have'** Because of such curiosity, it becomes associated with various thoughts and imagines them, thereby learning creativity and how to think. so i decided to build this program(StableChildren) which to help a little bit in this process.

## Features
- Through gesture recognition, children move words or sentences themselves by using their hands.
- Choice one of two paintings style.
- Teacher watches paintings first when received paintings. therefore children can't see anything until teacher is confirmed.

## Tech
- **Mediapipe gesture recognition**
- **Stablediffusion webui(automatic1111)**
- Django v4.2.2
- Python v3.10.1
- Vanila javascript, html, css
- Google colab pro for generate image by using GPU.
- **Used localStorage.**
- anime js opensource library (thank you for your dedication).
- Toastify opensource library (thank you for your dedication).

## Architecture

## Installation
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd (your download path)
python manage.py runserver(local)
```
**[Important]** you have to had 'Google colab pro' or your GPU (**CPU is not recommended for your image. its very slow..**)<br>
**[Important]** you have a 'web cam' for recognize hand if you don't want that's fine.

## How to use (Very Important)
- First run server and into http://localhost:8000/child/childPage/ (**This is main page for children**)

- Second you must host into http://localhost:8000/manager/managePage/ (**This is manage page for teacher (or admin)**)
- Third you must put translate api key for 'papago api'
- Fourth you must put google colab server url to stablediffusion_auto_1111.py
- When you finish reading books with children. The teacher types with the children what words or senetences come to mind. and then teahcer can decide. Whether to do it with a mouse or if the children will make their own gesture and move the words.
- When you Finish above process. 'bulb button' press and choice image style. and then again 'bulb button' **After this process children can see 'loading page' and teacher was received four images first.**
- Teacher must decide the image for children. The purpose of this process is to regenerate images that are sensational or have strange joints.
- **If you intentionally enter a word related to an adult, it will automatically detect it and receive a black image. this means that It rarely comes out if you don't type if intentionally. Approximately 80 to 90% of then are blocked, and the teacher checks them first, so they go through the filter again. Also, since the criterion of sensationalism is subjective, you can decide whether to regenerate or not.**
- Feel free enjoy my program :)

LoadingPage
- If you don't agree anything, children can't see generating images. so children can see this loading page until you agreed.<br>
